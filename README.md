# Healthcare Word2Vec Implementation

## Overview
This project implements a Word2Vec model specifically trained on healthcare-related text data. Word2Vec is a technique for natural language processing that creates vector representations of words, capturing semantic relationships between medical terms and concepts.

# Why you need to use Word2Vec for this task?

Word2Vec is a technique for natural language processing that creates vector representations of words, capturing semantic relationships between medical terms and concepts.

Particularly, in Healthcare, it's important to understand the semantic relationships between medical terms and concepts. Word2Vec is a powerful tool for this task as it can capture the meaning and context of words, even if they are not identical.

For future plans, I plan to use Word2Vec to create embeddings for the questions and answers in the MedQuAD dataset, and then train a model to answer questions based on the embeddings.

## Features
- Custom Word2Vec implementation using PyTorch
